## 📊 Database Schema & Relationships

### Core Tables

#### 1. Users Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- username (Unique)
- password_hash (bcrypt encrypted)
- role (enum: 'super_admin', 'user')
```

#### 2. Folders Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- name
- parent_id (Self-referencing foreign key)
- created_by (Foreign key to users.id)
- created_at, updated_at
- is_faviourite (boolean)
- is_deleted (boolean) - Soft delete
```

#### 3. Files Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- name, original_name
- folder_id (Foreign key to folders.id, nullable)
- file_path (Local storage path)
- file_url (Download URL)
- mime_type, size
- created_by (Foreign key to users.id)
- created_at, updated_at
- is_faviourite (boolean)
- is_deleted (boolean) - Soft delete
```

#### 4. Permissions Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign key to users.id)
- resource_id (ID of file/folder)
- resource_type (enum: 'folder', 'file')
- can_read (boolean)
- can_download (boolean)
- created_at, updated_at
- Unique constraint on (user_id, resource_id, resource_type)
```

#### 5. Shared Resources Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- resource_id, resource_type
- shared_by, shared_with (Foreign keys to users.id)
- share_token (UUID for public access)
- can_edit, can_download, can_share (boolean)
- expires_at (nullable timestamp)
- created_at, updated_at
```

### Key Relationships

1. **Hierarchical Folders:** Self-referencing parent-child relationships
2. **User Ownership:** Files and folders have `created_by` linking to users
3. **Permission Inheritance:** Folder permissions cascade to child folders and files
4. **Soft Deletes:** Both files and folders use `is_deleted` flag for data recovery
5. **Favorites System:** Both files and folders support favoriting with `is_faviourite`

## 🔐 Security & Authentication Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login:** Username/password → bcrypt verification → JWT token generation
2. **Token Storage:** Frontend stores JWT in localStorage
3. **Request Authorization:** Bearer token in Authorization header
4. **Middleware Chain:** authMiddleware → permissionMiddleware → controller

### Permission System
The system implements a sophisticated multi-layered permission model:

#### Permission Levels
1. **Super Admin:** Full system access, can manage users and all resources
2. **Resource Owner:** Full access to owned files/folders
3. **Explicit Permissions:** Granular read/download permissions via permissions table
4. **Inherited Permissions:** Folder permissions cascade to children

#### Permission Inheritance Logic
```javascript
// Folder permissions automatically apply to:
// 1. All child folders (recursive)
// 2. All files within the folder
// 3. All files in child folders (recursive)
```

### Security Features
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt with salt rounds
- **JWT Expiration:** Configurable token lifetime
- **CORS Protection:** Configured for frontend domain
- **Input Validation:** Server-side validation for all endpoints
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** Knex.js parameterized queries
- **File Upload Security:** Multer with file type validation

### State Management Strategy
- **Server State:** TanStack React Query for API data
- **Local State:** React useState for UI state
- **Caching:** Automatic query invalidation and refetching
- **Optimistic Updates:** Immediate UI feedback with rollback on errors

### Key Frontend Patterns

#### 1. Custom Hooks Pattern
Each domain (auth, files, folders, permissions) has dedicated hooks:
```typescript
// Example: useFiles hook
export const useFiles = (folderId: number | null = null) =>
  useQuery({
    queryKey: ["files", folderId],
    queryFn: () => fetchFiles(folderId),
    enabled: !!localStorage.getItem("token"),
  });
```

#### 2. Component Composition
- **Container Components:** Handle data fetching and business logic
- **Presentational Components:** Focus on UI rendering
- **Modal Components:** Reusable overlay interfaces

#### 3. Type Safety
- **Strict TypeScript:** All components and hooks are fully typed
- **API Response Types:** Matching frontend/backend interfaces
- **Form Validation:** Type-safe form handling
